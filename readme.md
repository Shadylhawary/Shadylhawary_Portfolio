## **I-MOST3MALL[Beta]** (Egypt Used Cars' Market Analysis)

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/gif1.gif">
</p>


- **Project Overview**: **MOST3MALL** is an open-free website based interactive dashboard, which enables a deep understanding of the **Egyptian Used Car Market.** NOW, the user who’s willing to sell/buy a used car is going to visit my website to see how the trend (deprecation factor) goes for each (Car Make, Car Model, Car Year) to decide at which point (Year/Kilometrage) to take an action.
- **Example**: Suppose that a Company X wants to buy used cars for their Sales Engineers, these cars will be purchased as an asset for the company so that they do not need to lose their money over time due to the depreciation value according to the market.

    **Without the tool**, the purchase team will spend time doing market research to find out the most suitable car for this job specification. Also, they will need to get in contact with car dealers to ask for the prices and to complete the purchasing process.

    **With the tool**, at a glance from anywhere, you can access the dashboard and generate your own visualizations to help you to choose the best option. 

    By entering the desired car parameters (Car Make, Car Model, Car Year” Optional”), the website Instantly generates two regression models describing **Depreciation X Kilometrage** and **Depreciation X Time**.

</p>

therefore, we found that “Daewoo Nubira “is the best option for the job specification, as we analyzed that the price of the car does not depreciate by kilometrage, and it has a stable price as we can buy a used car with 50,000 Kilometrage and after a working period we can sell it with approximate same price. That is a great deal rather than “Nissan Sunny”.

Finally, there are more interesting features and visualizations are going to be launched in the upcoming updates as I’m working on implementation of a ML algorithm to estimate the used car value(price) & Mobile app view to make it easier for the mobile users.

- **Project Details**: 
    - Data
    - Data Collection
    
        More Than 100k Ad were scraped from all the available buy/selling platforms(websites) in the Egyptian region with a Time Span 3 Months.

        **Tools**:

            Python → Beautifulsoup, Requests, lxml.

    - Data Wrangling

        Focused on removing/cleaning the raw data from the false ads and null rows, and then translating the data format into more usable form.

        **Tools**:
        
            Python → Pandas, Numpy.

    - Visualizations
    - Data Visualizations

        Visualizations are generated by **Plotly Dash**, open-source plotting library that supports over 40 unique chart types covering a wide range of statistical, financial, geographic, scientific, and 3-dimensional use-cases.

        **Dash** is the original low-code framework for rapidly building data apps in Python, R, Julia, and F# (experimental).
        Written on top of Plotly.js and React.js, Dash is ideal for building and deploying data apps with customized user interfaces. It's particularly suited for anyone who works with data.

        **Tools**:

            Python → Plotly, Dash, HTML, CSS.

    - DevOps
    -  Hosting

        Currently, the web app is running on my second PC which I considered as my hosting server, and I enable all inbound requests for this port to access my application.

        In the near future, I will containerize this app using docker to run the image file on AWS EC2 machine.

## **II-MENC Price List** (Multi-System Engineering Company)[Freelance Project]

MENC mission statement was to service the needs of the various technological, engineering organizations and companies through a professional conceptual service, supply, implementation, and support of fully integrated, multidisciplinary solutions covering the whole spectrum of needs of the users. To meet these requirements that work MENC aligned with the user personnel reaching an integral system adaptable to the needs and future anticipated requirements of the customer.

- **Project Overview**: The client requested a simple executable(.exe) application with a GUI to allow the user (Company Employee) to query in the database (Price List) for a certain item, the user should specify the currency price (USD) manually and the profit in percentage to make the program evaluate the selling price in (EGP) after certain calculations.

- **Project Details**

    - GUI
    - Menc Price List Application

        MENC Price list application is built by using the Tkinter module, a framework provides Python users a simple way to create GUI elements using the widgets found in the Tk toolkit.

        **Tools**:

                    Python → Tkinter.
    - Database 
    - SQlite

        I preferred using SQLite for its simplicity as I will need only one table to fill-in the price list provided. All the remaining work is done by handling and querying the db

        **Tools**:
        
            Python → SQlite.

## **III-Used Car Price Predictor** (Self Project)

  <p align="center">
    <img src="img/fig4.png">
  </p>

  - **Project Overview**: An algorithm to predict the used cars market value to help both buyers and sellers to determine the price range of the car without knowing any background about the market. The magic happens by just entering the needed car parameters (Car Make – Car Model -Car Year – Car Kilometrage).
 - **Project Details**
   - Data
     - Data Collection

        More Than 200k Ad were scraped from all the available buy/selling platforms(websites) in the Egyptian region.

        **Tools**:

                Python → Beautifulsoup, Requests, lxml.
   - Machine Learning
     - Algorithm

        Machine learning is part art and part science. When you look at machine learning algorithms, there is no one solution or one approach that fits all. There are several factors that can affect your decision to choose a machine learning algorithm.
        In My Case: I picked KNN over SVM algorithm, almost both gives me the same accuracy range 70%-76%. Which is not that good and needs some modifications.

        **Tools**:
        
                Python → Sklearn, Sklearn.neighbors, SVM.


## **IV-The British University in Egypt Smart Parking System**
  - **Project Overview**: Design & Implement a fully integrated Smart Parking System, this project is to use cheap IoT devices to monitor the parking lot, extract the license plate number, and update the database by the car location and parking time that can be accessed remotely. This way, all you need to do is to enter the car license plate numbers and obtain the parking fees & location instantly.

  - *Project Details*:
    - Embedded System Design
      - System Flow
      
        As we know about the embedded systems  is composed of CPU that process specific task or function, and of course the systems scale as to the complexity of the (micro-controller) used. In our system we used complex and wide micro-controllers.
        Raspberry Pi is one of the most best-selling computers in the world and used in a lot of applications with different fields.
